  I had been passionate about language(s) since very young, but I did not know much about linguistics as a serious science until I took Grammatical Analysis (with Stephanie Harves) in my junior year, a course that engrossingly changed my ways of viewing language(s) and made me realise what is interesting about language(s) is not merely etymology or how the phonetics differ amongst dialects but also the ubiquitous phenomena of form-meaning mismatch, the invisible existence of movements and the lurky possibilities of there hiding a complicated struture behind a seemingly simple word. I then decided to orient my academic pursuit toward becoming a linguist.

  In my spare time, I like also to watch films/series 🎬, do exercise 🏋🏻‍♂️, citywalk 🚶🏻 and enjoy alcohol 🍺. I write occasionally some poetry, which I will share with you if you are curious.
