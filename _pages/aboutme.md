I had been passionate about language(s) since very young, but I did not know much about linguistics as a serious science until I took Grammatical Analysis (with Stephanie Harves) in my junior year, a course that engrossingly changed my ways of looking at language(s). I then decided to orient my academic pursuit toward becoming a linguist.

In my spare time, I like also to watch films/series 🎬, do exercise 🏋🏻‍♂️, citywalk 🚶🏻 and enjoy alcohol 🍺. I write occasionally some poetry, which I will share with you if you are curious.
